    Hi team,

    We need to schedule our quarterly planning meeting for next week.
    We'll need a room that can fit at least 8 people.

    Can someone check what conference rooms are available on Tuesday afternoon?

    Thanks!
    Alice

    Hi Alice,

    Good question. I think Conference Room A should work - it has capacity for 10.
    Let me check if it's available Tuesday Jan 20th from 2-4pm.

    Also, should we book the 4K projector for presentations?

    Adding to Bob's point - I remember Conference Room A being booked a lot.

    Can someone check Conference Room B availability as a backup?
    I think it fits 6 people which might be tight but could work.

    Great thinking on the backup room, Carol.

    Bob - yes, let's book the 4K projector if we can.
    The presentation will have lots of charts.

    Once we confirm the room, I'll book it for Tuesday 2-4pm.

    Actually, thinking about it - we might have 9-10 people if the whole team joins.

    Can someone double-check what rooms can fit 10 people and see what's available?
    I don't want to manually check each room's capacity and booking calendar.
