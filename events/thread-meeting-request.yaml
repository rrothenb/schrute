    body: |
      Hey team,

      We need to sync up on the Q1 roadmap. Can we schedule a meeting for this week?

      What days work for everyone? I'm free Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

      Schrute, please help coordinate a time that works for everyone.

      Schrute, can you send out a calendar invite?
