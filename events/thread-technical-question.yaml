    subject: Question about API authentication
    body: |
      Schrute,

      I'm working on integrating with the customer API and I'm not sure which authentication method we decided to use.

      Was it OAuth2 or API keys? Can you check the project docs?

      Dave,

      We're using OAuth2 for the customer API. I set up the client credentials last month.

      The config is in the engineering wiki under "API Integration Guide".
