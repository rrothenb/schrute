    Hi Schrute,

    Can you generate a weekly status report for the team?
    I need to see what everyone's working on and what's been completed.

    Thanks!

    Alice, I committed to finishing the API integration by Friday.
    Should be done by end of day.

    Also working on the database migration - that's about 60% complete.

    I've been focused on the UI redesign.

    Completed: New dashboard layout, user profile page
    In progress: Settings page (should be done by Wednesday)

    I also need to review Bob's API work once it's ready.

    Schrute, this is exactly the kind of summary I need every week.

    Can you create a weekly status report that shows:
    - All open commitments grouped by person
    - What's been completed this week
    - What's in progress with estimated completion dates
    - Any blockers or dependencies between team members

    Format it nicely so I can share with leadership.
