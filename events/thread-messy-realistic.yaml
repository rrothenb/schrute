  body: |
    Hey team,

    We need to finalize the Q2 budget for Phoenix by end of week.
    Bob, can you send over the infrastructure estimates?

    David - did you finish the vendor analysis we talked about last month?

    Thanks,
    Alice

    Al,

    Yep working on it. Should have estimates by Wed. How was your weekend btw?

    One thing - Carol mentioned we should consider the cloud migration costs too.
    Are we including that in Phoenix or separate?

    Also I think Johnson is right that we're being too conservative on the timeline.
    We could probably shave 2 weeks off if we parallelize the testing phase.

    > David - did you finish the vendor analysis we talked about last month?

    Yes, sent it to you and Mike last Thursday. Did you not get it?

    TL;DR: VendorX is 40% cheaper but their SLA is sketchy. VendorY costs more
    but way more reliable. My recommendation is VendorY if budget allows.

    @Bobby - cloud migration should definitely be separate IMO. That's a
    different bucket and Sarah's team is handling that anyway.

    Dave - I didn't get it! Can you resend? Maybe it went to my spam?

    Bobby good point on the timeline. Let me check with Frank about parallelizing.
    Frank - can your QA team handle parallel testing with dev? We're trying to
    compress the schedule.

    Re: vendors - VendorY sounds good but we need to see if theres budget.
    What's the diff in actual $$$?

    Weekend was great btw! Took the kids to the zoo 🦁

    Alice,

    Yeah we can do parallel testing but we'll need 2 more QA engineers.
    Lisa and Tom are already maxed out on the legacy system work.

    Did Elena approve the headcount increase? I thought she was being
    pretty firm about no new hires til Q3.

    Also just FYI there's some confusion about who owns the integration
    testing - Bob's team or mine? Like we discussed back in November,
    I thought we agreed it was a shared responsibility but Bob seems to
    think it's all us.

    Frank - not trying to dump it all on you! I thought we agreed my team
    does unit + integration, your team does E2E + UAT?

    Maybe I misunderstood what Chen was saying in that meeting. Can Schrute
    pull up what we decided?

    Also here are the infrastructure estimates:
    - Dev environment: $12K
    - Staging: $8K
    - Prod: $25K
    - Monitoring tools: $5K
    - Total: $50K

    This assumes we go with AWS, not Azure. If we do Azure add 15%.

    Oh and Alice I saw Jennifer this morning and she said the Phoenix
    deadline might get moved up to end of March?? Is that confirmed?
    That would change everything...

  body: |
    Alice - sorry for delay, here are the vendor costs:

    VendorX: $85K/year (but 99.5% SLA, 24hr support response)
    VendorY: $120K/year (99.9% SLA, 2hr support response)

    The difference is $35K annually. Given how critical Phoenix is for
    the customer experience, I really think VendorY is worth it.

    Also to clarify what I said before - I was talking about the testing
    strategy with Frank's team, not trying to reassign responsibilities.
    We definitely agreed Bob's team owns integration in the architecture
    review. Frank's team picks it up for E2E.

    Can we just get everyone on a call to sort this out? This email chain
    is getting kinda crazy lol

  subject: Re: Q2 Budget for Project Phoenix - DECISIONS NEEDED
  body: |
    Ok team let me try to summarize what we need to decide:

    1. VENDOR: VendorY vs VendorX ($35K difference)
       - Dave recommends VendorY
       - Need to confirm budget allows

    2. TIMELINE: Can we compress by 2 weeks?
       - Requires parallel testing
       - Requires 2 more QA engineers (headcount issue)
       - Deadline MIGHT move to end of March (unconfirmed)

    3. RESPONSIBILITIES: Who owns what testing?
       - Seems like we agreed: Bob=integration, Frank=E2E
       - Need to confirm everyone's on same page

    4. INFRASTRUCTURE: $50K (Bob's estimate)
       - AWS vs Azure decision pending

    Total budget so far: $50K infra + $120K vendor = $170K
    (Plus potential headcount for QA which is separate)

    I'll set up a 30min call for tomorrow 2pm to finalize.

    Schrute - can you track these decisions once we make them?

    Sounds good. 2pm works.

    One more thing - I just remembered Michael wanted us to consider the
    disaster recovery costs too. That's probably another $15-20K.

    Also Greg from finance said we need formal approval from Karen for
    anything over $150K, so we're definitely gonna need that since we're
    at $170K already.

    Sorry to keep adding complications! 😅

    I'll be there.

    Just to be clear though - I can't commit to the compressed timeline
    without the extra headcount. If Elena blocks that, we stick with
    the original schedule.

    And yes, Bob's right about the testing split. My bad for the confusion.

    See you tomorrow.

    +1 to the call.

    FYI I ran into Rachel at lunch and she mentioned the Phoenix API
    requirements changed last week? Anyone know about this? Could impact
    the vendor selection if the API load is gonna be different than we
    thought.

    Should probably loop in Kevin from architecture if that's true.

  body: |
    Team,

    After the call today here's what we decided:

    ✅ VENDOR: Going with VendorY ($120K/year)
    ✅ INFRASTRUCTURE: Approved $50K (AWS, Bob's team to execute)
    ✅ DISASTER RECOVERY: Approved additional $18K (Bob to get exact quote)
    ✅ TESTING RESPONSIBILITIES: Confirmed Bob=integration, Frank=E2E+UAT
    ✅ TIMELINE: Keeping original schedule (no compression)
       - Elena did not approve additional QA headcount
       - March deadline rumor was FALSE (still end of April)

    ❌ AZURE: Not approved, staying with AWS
    ❌ TIMELINE COMPRESSION: Not approved due to headcount constraints

    TOTAL APPROVED BUDGET: $188K

    Next steps:
    - Bob: Get DR quote by EOW
    - David: Finalize VendorY contract with legal
    - Frank: Send testing plan by next Monday
    - Me: Get formal approval from Karen (finance requirement)

    Thanks everyone for working through this! Let's get Phoenix shipped! 🚀
