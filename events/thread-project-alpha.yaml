    body: |
      Hi Bob and Schrute,

      I'd like to kick off Project Alpha. The goal is to implement a new customer dashboard by end of Q2.

      Can you both review the requirements doc I shared last week and let me know if you have any concerns?

      Schrute, I'll need you to track all decisions and action items for this project.

      Thanks!
      Alice

      Hi Alice,

      I reviewed the requirements. Overall looks good, but I have concerns about the timeline.

      The authentication integration alone will take 3-4 weeks. Can we push the deadline to mid-Q2?

      Also, are we using React or Vue for the frontend? That wasn't clear in the doc.

      Bob,

      Good point on the timeline. Let's target May 15th instead of June 30th. That gives us more buffer.

      We've decided to go with React for this project. It's what the team knows best.

      I'll commit to getting you the final API specs by end of this week.

      Perfect! May 15th works for me.

      I'll start on the authentication module this week and will have a prototype ready by Jan 30th.

      Schrute, can you send me a summary of all the key decisions we've made so far?

      Thanks,
      Bob
