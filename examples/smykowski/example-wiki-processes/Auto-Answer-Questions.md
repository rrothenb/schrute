# Process: Auto-Answer Questions in Issues

## Purpose
Automatically detect and answer common questions in issues by referencing project documentation.

## Trigger
**When:** A new issue is created
**Event:** `issues.opened`

## Actions

1. **Detect if the issue is a question**
   - Analyze issue content to determine if it's asking a question
   - Extract the core question being asked
   - Skip if not a question or confidence too low

2. **Generate an answer**
   - Search wiki pages and README for relevant information
   - Use AI to synthesize a helpful answer
   - Include references to documentation sources

3. **Post answer as comment**
   - Only post if confidence >= 70%
   - Mark for human review if confidence is moderate
   - Include disclaimer that this is an automated response

## Configuration

```yaml
confidence_threshold: 0.7
max_wiki_pages: 3
include_readme: true
```

## How It Works

When a new issue is opened, Tom will:
1. Analyze if the issue contains a question
2. If yes, search project documentation (wiki + README)
3. Use AI to generate a helpful answer based on available docs
4. Post the answer as a comment if confidence is sufficient
5. Add a friendly note that this is Tom helping out

## Example

**Issue:** "How do I configure authentication with OAuth?"

**Tom's Response:**
> Hi! I found some information that might help answer your question.
>
> Based on the project documentation, here's how to configure OAuth authentication:
>
> 1. Set up your OAuth provider credentials in `.env`:
>    ```
>    OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
>    OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=your_secret
>    ```
>
> 2. Configure the OAuth callback URL in `config/auth.js`
>
> 3. The authentication flow is documented in our [Authentication Wiki Page](link)
>
> Let me know if this helps or if you need more clarification!
>

## Benefits

- **Instant responses**: Users get help immediately, even outside business hours
- **Reduces maintainer burden**: Common questions answered automatically
- **Documentation-driven**: Answers based on actual project docs, not generic advice
- **Always improving**: As wiki grows, answers become more comprehensive

## When Tom Won't Answer

Tom will skip answering if:
- Issue is not actually a question (bug report, feature request, etc.)
- Question is too specific or requires deep technical knowledge
- No relevant documentation found
- Confidence in answer is below threshold

In these cases, the issue remains open for human response.

## Customization

Adjust the behavior:
- **confidence_threshold**: Lower = more answers (but potentially less accurate)
- **max_wiki_pages**: How many wiki pages to search for context
- **include_readme**: Set to false to skip README in searches

## Safety

Tom includes a disclaimer on all automated answers and encourages users to confirm the information. If an answer seems incorrect, anyone can reply to correct it.
