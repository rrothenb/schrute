# Smykowski: AI Project Coordinator for GitHub

> *"What would you say... you do here?"*  
> *"I take the specs from the customers and bring them down to the engineers."*

**Smykowski** (Tom S., Tom Smykowski) is a specific deployment of the Schrute framework designed to act as an AI project coordinator for software development teams using GitHub. Named after the character from *Office Space*, Tom handles the mundane coordination tasks that keep projects running smoothly—without trying to make strategic decisions or act as a domain expert.

## Philosophy: Assistant, Not Expert

Tom operates under the **"micro-intern" philosophy**:

✅ **What Tom Does Well:**
- Follows explicit instructions reliably
- Never forgets commitments or deadlines
- Works 24/7 without complaining
- Handles repetitive coordination tasks without error
- Tracks who's responsible for what
- Maintains institutional memory in the wiki

❌ **What Tom Does NOT Do:**
- Make strategic or technical decisions
- Exercise independent judgment
- Interpret vague requirements
- Assess code quality or architecture
- Prioritize features without guidance
- "Read between the lines"

**Tom's role:** Process coordinator who knows how your team works, not an expert who evaluates technical merit.

---

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Natural Communication (Email-First)

Tom communicates via email as if he were a remote team member—no special syntax, no configuration UI, no separate tool to learn.

**How It Works:**
- Send emails to `tom@smykowski.work` (or your configured address)
- Tom responds with natural language
- All coordination happens through normal email conversations
- Tom can be CC'd on team emails to observe and extract action items

**Example Interaction:**
```
From: alice@team.com
To: tom@smykowski.work
Subject: Sprint Planning Notes

Hi Tom,

Here are the notes from today's sprint planning:

- Bob will implement the authentication flow by Friday
- Carol needs to review the API design by Wednesday
- We decided to postpone the mobile app until Q2

Can you track these?

Thanks,
Alice
```

```
From: tom@smykowski.work
To: alice@team.com
Subject: Re: Sprint Planning Notes

Hi Alice,

Got it! I've created the following GitHub issues:

- #123: Implement authentication flow (assigned to Bob, due Friday)
- #124: Review API design (assigned to Carol, due Wednesday)

I've also updated the project wiki to reflect the Q2 postponement 
of the mobile app.

I'll check in with Bob and Carol on Thursday if I don't see updates.

Tom
```

## 🎯 Special Features for Small Projects & Solo Developers

Tom is especially valuable for **small teams and solo maintainers** who don't have dedicated project managers. These features help reduce the burden of community management:

### Auto-Labeling New Issues

**Problem:** Manual issue triage takes time you don't have.

**Tom's Solution:** Automatically classifies and labels new issues using AI.

```
New Issue: "App crashes when clicking submit button"
↓
Tom analyzes with AI
↓
Labels applied: bug, needs-triage, ui
Confidence: 92% ✓
```

**Benefits:**
- Instant triage for obvious bugs/features/questions
- Consistent labeling across all issues
- Only auto-labels when confidence is high (>80%)
- Keeps your issue tracker organized

**Setup:** Add the [Auto-Label process](example-wiki-processes/Auto-Label-New-Issues.md) to your wiki.

### Auto-Answer Questions in Issues

**Problem:** Users open issues asking questions already covered in documentation.

**Tom's Solution:** Detects questions and posts helpful answers from your wiki/README.

```
New Issue: "How do I configure authentication?"
↓
Tom detects this is a question
↓
Searches wiki pages + README
↓
Generates answer with documentation references
↓
Posts comment if confident (>70%)
```

**Example Response:**
> Hi! I found some information that might help.
>
> To configure authentication, you need to:
> 1. Set `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` in your `.env` file
> 2. Configure the callback URL in `config/auth.js`
>
> For more details, see our [Authentication Wiki Page](#).
>
> _This answer was automatically generated by Tom from project documentation._

**Benefits:**
- Instant responses 24/7, even when you're asleep
- Reduces repetitive "RTFM" answers
- Answers based on YOUR docs, not generic advice
- Encourages users to check docs before asking

**Setup:** Add the [Auto-Answer process](example-wiki-processes/Auto-Answer-Questions.md) to your wiki.

### Wiki Pages from Discussions

**Problem:** Valuable discussions get buried and forgotten. New contributors ask the same questions.

**Tom's Solution:** Converts closed discussions into permanent wiki documentation.

```
Discussion closes: "Should we use REST or GraphQL?"
↓
Tom analyzes the full thread
↓
Extracts decisions, rationale, key points
↓
Generates formatted wiki page
↓
Posts link: "📝 I've created a wiki page: API Architecture Decision"
```

**Generated Wiki Content:**
```markdown
# API Architecture Decision: REST vs GraphQL

## Summary
Team decided to use REST for v2 API.

## Rationale
- Simpler for CRUD operations
- Team has more REST experience
- Faster implementation (2 weeks saved)

## Participants
@alice, @bob, @carol

---
Generated from Discussion #42
```

**Benefits:**
- Preserves institutional knowledge automatically
- Makes onboarding new contributors easier
- Creates searchable documentation from discussions
- Saves manual documentation work

**Setup:** Add the [Wiki Generator process](example-wiki-processes/Generate-Wiki-From-Discussions.md) to your wiki.

### Perfect for Low-Activity Projects

These features are specifically designed for projects where:
- **One person** (or very small team) maintains the project
- **Low volume** of issues/PRs (not hundreds per day)
- **Documentation exists** but users don't always find it
- **Maintainer time is precious** and shouldn't be spent on repetitive tasks

Tom won't spam you—he only acts when confident and uses your actual documentation as the source of truth.

---

## Core Coordination Workflows

### 1. Meeting Follow-Up Automation

**Problem Solved:**
Meeting notes contain action items, but they get lost or forgotten. Nobody's sure who owns what or when things are due.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Receive meeting notes via email
2. Parse for action items and commitments
3. Create GitHub Issues for each action
4. Assign to appropriate team members
5. Set realistic deadlines
6. Cross-reference back to meeting notes (Discussion or wiki)
7. Send confirmations to attendees
8. Track progress and send reminders

**Example:**
```
Email Subject: "Sprint Planning - Oct 27"

Tom extracts:
- "Bob will implement auth" → Issue #123, assigned to Bob
- "Carol to review API" → Issue #124, assigned to Carol
- "Deploy by Friday" → Milestone with Friday deadline

Tom creates Discussion post summarizing decisions
Tom sends confirmation email with links to Issues
Tom schedules reminder checks for Thursday
```

### 2. Deadline & Commitment Tracking

**Problem Solved:**
People commit to deadlines in emails or meetings, but there's no central tracking. Things slip without anyone noticing until it's too late.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Detect commitments in emails/Discussions
2. Extract who, what, when
3. Create or update GitHub Issues
4. Set deadline reminders
5. Check status before deadlines
6. Send polite reminders if no updates
7. Escalate if deadlines pass
8. Document slippages for retrospectives

**Smart Features:**
- Distinguishes "this week" from "by Friday"
- Understands "by EOD" vs "by end of month"
- Adjusts for weekends and holidays
- Learns team's typical response times
- Adapts reminder timing to urgency

### 3. Responsibility Handoff Management

**Problem Solved:**
When team members go on vacation or leave, their responsibilities fall through the cracks. The replacement doesn't know what they're covering.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Team member notifies Tom of absence
2. Tom identifies all assigned Issues and PRs
3. Tom checks team capacity and expertise
4. Tom suggests reassignments
5. Tom briefs the replacement
6. Tom creates Discussion post about changes
7. Tom schedules reminder to reverse changes
8. Tom restores original assignments on return

**Example:**
```
Alice: "Tom, I'm on vacation next week. Please reassign my work."

Tom:
- Finds Alice's 5 open Issues
- Finds Alice as reviewer on 3 PRs
- Suggests Bob for Issues #100-102 (backend work)
- Suggests Carol for Issues #103-104 (frontend work)
- Suggests Ted as PR reviewer
- Creates Discussion: "Alice's vacation handoff (Oct 30 - Nov 6)"
- Briefs each person individually
- Schedules Nov 7 to restore assignments
```

### 4. PR Review Coordination

**Problem Solved:**
PRs sit unreviewed for days. Reviewers don't know what needs attention. Authors don't know who to ping.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. PR opened → Tom suggests reviewers
2. After 24 hours → Polite reminder comment
3. After 48 hours → DM to reviewer
4. After 72 hours → Escalate to team lead
5. Track review patterns to improve suggestions
6. Balance reviewer workload
7. Generate weekly PR review metrics

**Smart Features:**
- Learns who reviews what types of code
- Avoids overloading busy reviewers
- Respects team's preferred review SLAs
- Adjusts urgency based on labels/milestones
- Celebrates fast review turnarounds

### 5. Workload Balancing

**Problem Solved:**
Some team members are overloaded while others have capacity. Nobody wants to be "that person" who says they're overwhelmed.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Track assignments per team member
2. Calculate relative workload
3. Flag significant imbalances to team lead
4. Suggest specific reassignments
5. Handle the awkward "can you take this?" conversation
6. Update wiki with current workload status
7. Generate weekly balance reports

**Example:**
```
Tom notices:
- Alice: 12 open Issues
- Bob: 2 open Issues
- Carol: 5 open Issues

Tom emails team lead:
"Alice's workload is 2x the team average. Suggest reassigning 
Issues #200-203 to Bob (all are backend work he's familiar with)."

Tom handles the actual reassignment and notifications
```

### 6. Status Synthesis & Reporting

**Problem Solved:**
Managers ask "What's the status?" and everyone scrambles to update tickets. Half the team doesn't respond. Manager pieces together incomplete info.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Manager asks Tom for project status
2. Tom reads all Issues, PRs, comments
3. Tom synthesizes: completion %, blockers, risks
4. Tom provides summary with evidence links
5. Tom identifies what needs human attention
6. Tom suggests what to discuss in standup

**Example:**
```
Manager: "Tom, what's the status of Project X?"

Tom replies:
"Project X is 70% complete (14/20 issues closed).

✅ Completed: Authentication, API design, database schema
🚧 In Progress: Frontend (Carol, 60% done)
⚠️  Blockers:
  - Issue #150: Waiting on external API keys (pending since Oct 25)
  - Issue #152: Merge conflict needs resolution

⏰ At Risk:
  - Issue #148: Bob's PR has been in review for 4 days

Next Actions:
  - Follow up with vendor on API keys
  - Ping reviewers on Issue #148

Sprint deadline: Nov 1 (4 days) - Achievable if blockers resolve"
```

### 7. Process Discovery & Optimization

**Problem Solved:**
Teams don't notice their own workflow bottlenecks. Process improvements don't happen because nobody's tracking metrics.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Analyze GitHub Project board flow
2. Identify patterns (e.g., "PRs wait 3 days for review")
3. Create Discussion with suggested improvements
4. Track metrics after changes implemented
5. Report on improvement results
6. Document successful process changes in wiki

**Example:**
```
Tom creates Discussion:
"I've noticed PRs typically wait 3 days for review, which is 
blocking feature completion. 

Pattern: Most PRs are created Mon-Wed, but reviews happen Thu-Fri.

Suggested improvement: Rotating daily review duty, or PR review 
as first task each morning.

Would this work for the team?"

[Team discusses, implements rotating review duty]

Tom tracks: Average PR review time drops to 1.2 days
Tom documents: "PR Review Process" wiki page with new workflow
```

### 8. Dependency Tracking

**Problem Solved:**
Issues are blocked by other issues, but nobody's tracking dependencies. Work gets started before blockers are resolved.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Detect "blocked by" references in Issues
2. Create dependency links
3. Notify when blockers are resolved
4. Update dependent Issue status
5. Visualize dependency chains
6. Warn about circular dependencies
7. Generate dependency reports

### 9. Sprint Retrospective Support

**Problem Solved:**
Retrospectives are based on vague memories. Nobody has concrete data on what happened during the sprint.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Throughout sprint: Track velocity, completion %
2. Monitor what went well (fast PR reviews, early completions)
3. Monitor what didn't (missed deadlines, blocked work)
4. Generate retrospective data Discussion
5. Include metrics: velocity, cycle time, issue age
6. Highlight patterns for team discussion
7. Document action items from retro

---

## Integration with Team Workflows

### Onboarding New Team Members

**Problem Solved:**
New team members don't know who does what, what the processes are, or where to find information.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. New member added to GitHub → Tom notices
2. Tom creates Introduction Discussion
3. Tom provides links to key wiki pages
4. Tom explains Tom's role and how to work with Tom
5. Tom introduces team members and their roles
6. Tom offers to answer onboarding questions
7. Tom monitors new member's first week activity

**Generated Wiki Pages:**
- "Team Structure & Roles"
- "How We Work: Process Guide"
- "Common Tasks & How-Tos"
- "Who to Ask About What"

### Daily Standup Support

**Problem Solved:**
Standups take too long because everyone's reading from tickets. Nobody remembers what they committed to yesterday.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Before standup: Generate status summary
2. List each person's completed work
3. List current in-progress items
4. Flag any missed commitments
5. Highlight blockers needing discussion
6. Suggest standup agenda topics
7. Post summary to channel/Discussion

**Standup Summary Format:**
```
**Daily Standup Summary - Oct 27**

Alice:
- ✅ Completed: Issue #100 (auth flow)
- 🚧 Working on: Issue #105 (frontend dashboard)
- No blockers

Bob:
- ✅ Completed: PR #50 merged
- 🚧 Working on: Issue #110 (API refactor)
- ⚠️  Note: Issue #110 was due yesterday, needs update

Carol:
- ✅ Completed: Code review on 3 PRs
- 🚧 Working on: Issue #115 (mobile design)
- 🚫 Blocked: Waiting on design assets from vendor

**Topics for Discussion:**
- Bob's Issue #110 deadline slip
- Carol's blocker on vendor assets
```

### Cross-Team Coordination

**Problem Solved:**
Dependencies on other teams get lost. Nobody knows when the other team will deliver what we need.

**Tom's Workflow:**
1. Detect external dependencies in Issues
2. Create tracking Issue for external dependency
3. Send check-in reminders to liaison
4. Update team on external progress
5. Notify when external dependencies resolve
6. Document cross-team processes in wiki

It's due Friday and I haven't seen any recent updates. 
Everything okay? Let me know if you need help!"
```

```
"Hi team, I noticed our PR review time has dropped from 
3 days to 1.2 days since we started the rotating review 
duty. Nice work! 🎉"
```

```
"Bob, I see you're assigned to 8 issues while Carol has 2. 
Would it make sense to reassign Issues #200-202 to Carol? 
They're all frontend work she's familiar with."
```

**When Tom Doesn't Know:**
```
"I'm not sure whether Issue #150 is blocked by Issue #148. 
Could you clarify the dependency?"
```

**When Tom Makes Mistakes:**
```
"Oops, I assigned Issue #175 to the wrong person. 
I've reassigned it to Sarah (who actually committed to it). 
Sorry for the confusion!"
```

## Why "Smykowski"?

From the movie *Office Space*:

> **Bob Slydell**: "What would you say... you do here?"  
> **Tom Smykowski**: "Well look, I already told you! I deal with the goddamn customers so the engineers don't have to! I have people skills! I am good at dealing with people, can't you understand that? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!"

Tom Smykowski perfectly represents the role: **handling coordination so engineers can focus on engineering**. He's not doing the technical work, but he's critical to keeping things running smoothly.

The name is a bit tongue-in-cheek (especially given Tom's eventual fate in the movie), but it captures the essence: Tom handles the "taking specs from customers and bringing them to engineers" work that's essential but often undervalued.
